### Diablo-like RPG Interface

My own React.js (and more) study-project

### Features

Just moving the items and stats calculation basically

Also you can change the name of the character

But there is more under the hood:

- Matrix inventory (with all the consequences)
- Smart info modal for items
- Inventory scroll for smaller screens
- Side panels
- Smart adaptive design!

And more currently not properly implemented (and I wonder if I do):

- New items creation
- Effects display
- And some other stuff to make it actually work as intended

### How to run

Install deps with

```
npm install
```

Run with

```
npm start
```

The app will be availiable at ```localhost:3000```
